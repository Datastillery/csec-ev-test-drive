As a driver, we want to make sure you have the best Test Drive experience possible. In order to do so, please review the following regarding what to expect during your experience and other fun details we have in store for you!
TIME COMMITMENT
You will enjoy a 10-15 minute driving experience on a predetermined route on both city streets and the highway. The whole experience from check-in to drive completion should last about 25-30 minutes. Please arrive 5 minutes prior to your drive time.
THINGS TO BRING
All you need to bring is your valid driver’s license and your confirmation code. It’s that easy!
HOW TO GET THERE
The Smart Columbus Experience Center is located at 170 S Civic Center Dr. Columbus, OH 43215 - in the heart of downtown right on the Scioto Mile. The Center is accessible via bicycle, COTA, ride-hailing services, and more smart mobility options. If you drive, there is metered street parking and the Columbus Commons parking garage (about a 7-minute walk from the Center).
WHAT TO EXPECT
1. First, check-in at the reception desk located in the Experience Center.

2. Then the experience begins! A Smart Columbus Ambassador will introduce you to the vehicle you registered to drive and direct you on the route, while answering your questions about your vehicle and EVs in general. Feel free to bring a friend to ride along! Please note, children requiring a car seat are not permitted to ride.

3. After your drive, you will complete a quick post-drive survey to inform anonymized, cutting edge research on EV technology and adoption!

4. After your drive is complete, feel free to check out our highly interactive and educational exhibits on the future of smart mobility located in the Experience Center.

You are encouraged to share your experience via social media and tag us- @smartcbus or #smartcbus. Sign up for our newsletter here to keep up with Smart Columbus! If you have any additional questions before you drive, please reach out to us at ***REMOVED***.
